# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing employee and department data in a company using SQL queries. The dataset consists of employee details, job history, department information, and salary grades. The goal is to answer various business questions through data manipulation, aggregation, and filtering.

### Data Structure:
1. **Employee Table (`EMP`)**: Contains employee details such as employee number, name, job title, manager, hire date, salary, and department number.
2. **Department Table (`DEPT`)**: Contains department details including department number, name, and location.
3. **Salary Grade Table (`SALGRADE`)**: Contains salary ranges for each salary grade.
4. **Job History Table (`JOBHISTORY`)**: Records job titles, department numbers, and start and end dates for employeesâ€™ previous roles.

   
### SQL Queries:
The queries cover a variety of analysis tasks, including employee details, department-related insights, salary analysis, and employee job history.
